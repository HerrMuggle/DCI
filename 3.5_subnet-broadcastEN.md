# Explanation: Broadcast address, network address and subnet mask

## What is a network address?

The network address is the first address in a subnet. It identifies the entire network and is used to address all devices within this network. Data packets sent to the network address do not reach all hosts in the network directly, but through special routing protocols.

- Example: If your subnet is defined with the IP address `192.168.1.0/24`, then the network address is `192.168.1.0`.

- Function: The network address is reserved and cannot be assigned to any device (PC or router).

## What is a broadcast address?

The **broadcast address** is the last address in a **subnet**. When a packet is sent to this address, it is distributed to all devices in the network.

- Example: In the subnet `192.168.1.0/24`, the broadcast address is `192.168.1.255`.

- Function: Enables simultaneous communication with all hosts in the network.

**Analogy**: Think of the broadcast address like an office announcement. When one person speaks into the microphone, all employees in the entire building hear the message.

## What is a subnet mask?

The subnet mask determines how many IP addresses are available within a particular network. It separates the network part of an IP address from the host part.

### Example:

- IP address: `192.168.1.10`.

- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0` or `/24`

Subnet mask in binary representation:

```
255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
```

- The first 24 bits (left) represent the network.

- The last 8 bits (right) represent the hosts.

#### How does the subnet mask help with network partitioning?

The subnet mask determines how many devices are possible in a network segment (subnet). The more bits are reserved for the network, the fewer IP addresses remain for hosts.

/30 -> network + broadcast

/24 -> 256(254 devices (e.g. PCs) + network + broadcast)

/16 -> 65,536(65,534 devices(e.g. PCs) )+ network + broadcast

/8 -> 16,777,214(16,777,212 devices (e.g. PCs) )+ network + broadcast

## Example: Split up 30 PCs in a company

**Task**:

You have 24 PCs in a company network. Your bad boss wants to divide them into two groups:

- Group A: 12 PCs

- Group B: 12 PCs

**Step 1: Select the appropriate subnet mask**

To divide the PCs, we need two separate subnets, each with at least 15 available IP addresses.

- The next largest subnet mask, which allows **16 addresses** per subnet, is `/28` (or `255.255.255.240`).

**Why /28?**

- /28 means that the first 28 bits are reserved for the network and the last 4 bits are available for the hosts. This results in 16 addresses per subnet:

  - 1 address for the network address

  - 1 address for the broadcast address

  - 14 addresses for hosts (devices such as PCs)

**Step 2: Subnet division**

Let's assume that the main network has the IP address `192.168.1.0/24`. We can divide this network into several subnets:

1. subnet 1:

   - Network address: `192.168.1.0`.

   - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.240` or `/28`.

   - Available host addresses: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.12`.

   - Broadcast address: `192.168.1.13`.

2. subnet 2:

   - Network address: `192.168.1.14`.

   - Subnet mask: `255.255.255.240` or `/28`.

   - Available host addresses: `192.168.1.14` to `192.168.1.26`.

   - Broadcast address: `192.168.1.27`.

**Step 3: IP assignment to the PCs**

- Group A: 12 PCs receive the IP addresses `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.12`.

- Group B: 12 PCs receive the IP addresses `192.168.1.14` to `192.168.1.26`.

**Step 4: Connecting the subnets**

- Router: To connect the two subnets, use a router. The router can forward packets between the two subnets and ensure that both groups can communicate with each other if necessary.

PC1 = `192.168.1.1`.

PC2 = `192.168.1.2`.

laptop = `192.168.1.3`.

HP printer = `192.168.1.4`.

BroadcastServer = `192.168.1.5` => Sends message(Broadcast) through `.0` to all IP's from `.1` to `.14`
