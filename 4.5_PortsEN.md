# Ports - The door openers for networks

## What are ports?

A **port** is a **logical number** that determines **which program or protocol** is addressed in a network.

**Comparison**: An IP address is like a **house address**, a **port is the door number**.

**Example:**

```
192.168.1.10:80
```

- 192.168.1.10` = IP address of the computer
- `:80` = Port for HTTP web server

## Why are there ports?

A computer or server can have **several services at the same time**.  
Ports ensure that the data is routed to the **correct program**.

**Example:**

- **Port 80** → websites (HTTP)
- **Port 443** → Secure websites (HTTPS)
- **Port 22** → SSH remote access

## What are ports used for?

Ports are used for **data transfer & communication between devices**:

- **Websites & servers** (HTTP/HTTPS → Port 80/443)
- Remote access to servers** (SSH → port 22, RDP → port 3389)
- Email services** (SMTP, IMAP, POP3 → ports 25, 143, 110)
- Online games & VoIP** (e.g. Minecraft → port 25565, Discord → dynamic ports)

# How can I unlock a port?

## 1 Via the firewall

A **firewall blocks all unknown ports by default**.

**Unblocking a port under Windows**:

1. open **Control Panel** → **Windows Defender Firewall**
2. click on **Advanced settings**
3. select **Incoming rules** → **New rule**
4. select **Port** → enter port number (e.g. `25565` for Minecraft)
5. **Allow connection** → Save rule

**Linux (UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall)**:

```sh
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp # Enable SSH
sudo ufw allow 25565 # Enable Minecraft server
sudo ufw enable # Enable firewall
```

## 2 In the router (port forwarding)

1. open the router (192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1 or domainName.ip in the browser)
2. go to Port Forwarding
3. enter
   - Port (e.g. 25565 for Minecraft)
   - IP of the target computer (e.g. 192.168.1.100)
   - Protocol (TCP/UDP)
4. save & restart router

# Why port forwarding?

- Without port forwarding, external devices cannot access servers behind a router.
- Necessary for gaming servers, web servers or remote access.

# Which ports are important?

Standard ports

| **Port** | **Service** | **Description** |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 22 | SSH | Secure remote connection |
| 25 | SMTP | Sending e-mails |
| 53 | DNS | Domain-to-IP Resolution |
| 80 | HTTP | Websites (insecure) |
| 110 | POP3 | Receiving e-mails |
| 143 | IMAP | Email reception (modern) |
| 443 | HTTPS | Websites (encrypted) |
| 3306 | MySQL | Database access |
| 3389 | RDP | Remote Desktop for Windows |

**Security note:**  
Open ports can be a **security risk**!

- **Close unnecessary ports**
- **Use firewalls**
- **Change SSH to non-standard ports (e.g. 2222 instead of 22)**

# TL;DR

- Enable communication between programs & devices
- Required for web servers, online games, remote access & email
- Often need to be released manually (firewall & port forwarding)
- Open ports can be security risks → Take protective measures
- Without ports, there would be no internet communication!
